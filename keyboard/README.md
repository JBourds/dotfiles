# Keyboard Setup

This directory contains a set of keyboard macros/remaps for the Kinesis
Advantage 2. These introduce layers that modify the home row and adjacent rows
to limit the amount of keyboard travel and make programming punctuation easier
to access.

## Uploading

Enter power user mode with these key strokes: `progm + Shift + Esc`

Make the virtual drive appear with: `progm + F1`

Now, mount the drive and copy `kinesis_qwerty.txt` to `/active/qwerty.txt`.

Unmount the drive, press `progm + F1` again to unload virtual drive mode, and
press `progm + qwert` to ensure the changes take effect.
