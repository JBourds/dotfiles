# Neovim

Neovim is setup using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
My full config can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/JBourds/neohim).

## Necessary Installs

lazy.nvim should automatically install itself when sourced. Some packages do
require additional install methods (e.g., `pyright` needs `npm` to install correctly).
