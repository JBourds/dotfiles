# Fish

Install fish with `sudo pacman -S fish`

After it is installed, configure fish as the default shell using:

`chsh -s /usr/bin/fish`

(Assuming fish is installed at `/usr/bin/fish`)

Then, logout and log back in to your new shell.

- List available shells (as derived from `/etc/shells`) using `chsh -l`
